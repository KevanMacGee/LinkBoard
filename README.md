## ðŸ”— LinkBoard  (name is tentative) 
#### ðŸš¨ðŸš§ This project is currently in a "late stage prototype" status. Some features are broken, there are code conflicts and a lot of clean-up to be done. Considerate it a late Alpha or early Beta. ðŸš§

LinkBoard is an app to create lists of often used bookmarks for specific niches or projects. It started as a quick and dirty vibe coded project superficially for coding and web development links, but I have started to clean it up for public use. Right now, you can drag the links from one category to another, but that feels like extra functionality and might be removed.

###  Features
- Bookmarks can be added and sorted into topic areas upon creation, but they are also "drag-and-dropable" later.
- The app automatically pulls the favicon for any link that is added.
- Data can be exported into a JSON file, and similarly imported from the same.

###  Issues
- There are some design and visual inconsistencies. (Update: Many have been addressed and it's getting down to the last several personal nick-picky visual issues.)
- Due to browser restrictions, the bookmarklet feature does not work if you use a local copy of the app from your computer's disk drive. To use the bookmarklet, you would have to deploy it to something like Cloudflare or a traditional web server. 
  - You could server the local file as a local server, but it would always have to be running.
  - This might be solved by replacing the bookmarklet with an actual browser extension.

- There is a slight bug where if you drag a link from one column to another and drop it in the empty space at the bottom of a column, it doesn't register. In short, if you drag a link from one column, it has to pass over a link in the new column before the app registers it's being moved.
- Local storage can inherently be flaky, I plan to move to a proper database solution.
- The code is currently inline and unwieldy, that is a relic of the app being vibe coded in the beginning.

###  Future Plans
- Clean the code from inline css and js to proper organization.
- Move the buttons to a collapsible sidebar.
- Move from data being handled by local storage to a a database.
- (Maybe) Replace the "bookmarklet" feature with a full browser extension. The bookmarklet feature works just fine if you copy the app and host it somewhere online or serve it from a local server on your machine. I personally prefer to use this app as a static, non-hosted copy on my machine. I have to figure out if other users will prefer to

## LinkBoard

LinkBoard (name is tentative) is an app to keep links on different topic areas. I created it primarily to have a quick reference to links I use when making web sites. Right now, you can drag the links from one category to another, but that feels like extra functionality and will likely be removed. The app automatically pulls the favicon from the site, but there is currently no fallback when it fails. 

This started out as a vibe coded, quick and dirty project which is why the code is inline and it uses local storage. If I decide to put it online and allow users, those issues will be addressed.
